Hi, welcome to my Github profile.

I'm Michele Adduci, a Computer Engineer with a passion for embedded systems, Computer Vision and security.

You can find more information about me on my personal site at https://madduci.netlify.app

I maintain a handful list of Docker Images, mostly to speedup the development and the integration with CI/CD systems, plus some other C++ or Java Projects I've published openly.
